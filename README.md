# Data Professional Survey Dashboard

## Project Overview
This Power BI case study analyzes a survey of data professionals to understand trends in the data domain. The survey collected responses from 630 participants on various aspects, including:

- Career switch into data roles
- Salary satisfaction
- Work/life balance
- Satisfaction with coworkers, management, and upward mobility
- Difficulty breaking into data roles
- Expectations from new jobs
- Demographics: gender, current age, highest level of education, ethnicity, residential country
- Professional details: current title, industry, favorite programming language, current salary

Additional metadata includes unique survey IDs, submission timestamps, and time taken to complete the survey.

The dashboard visualizes key metrics, distributions, and breakdowns to provide insights into the data professional landscape, such as salary trends by title, industry representation, and satisfaction levels.

## Dashboard Features
